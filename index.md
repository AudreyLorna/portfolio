## About me

My name is Audrey Lorna Okeyo and below are projects I've worked on along with my groupmates during the software engineering and management course in the University of Gothenburg.

### Trailgage

This project falls under the Systems Development module of th programme. The requirements of this project was to come up with a software system that is able to remotely control a car. We came up with Trailgage which is a smart luggage carrier that enables the user to free their hands when moving around airports and train stations. My main contribution to this project was the app design.
