## About me

My name is Audrey Lorna Okeyo and below are projects I've worked on along with my groupmates during the software engineering and management course in the University of Gothenburg.

### Trailgage

This project falls under the Systems Development module of the programme. The requirements of this project was to come up with a software system that is able to remotely control a car. We came up with Trailgage which is a smart luggage carrier that enables the user to free their hands when moving around airports and train stations. My main contribution to this project was the app design.


### EventNode

Eventnode is a website that enables users to upload, find and participate in events. The main requirements for this project was to develop a website with CRUD characteristics. This was able to be achieved using Vue, HTML,CSS and Javascript. I mainly contributed to the frontend sector of the website.


### Dentistimo

Dentistimo is a website that functions with the assistance of distributed systems that embody several architectures such as pipe and filter, server-client and publish-subscribe. The website's purpose is to enable users to book appointments at different dentist offices  and dentists to post available times with the help of a broker (MQTT). My main role of this project was designing the UI and coding the frontend. This gave me an opportunity to work with Vue, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Muse

Muse is an AI-based website that uses classification to determine the similarity of an uploaded photo to one of 50 renowned artists. This project was bulit using Django among other dependencies such as kuberenetes and docker for deployment and pandas, tensorflow and ResNet50 for the model development. My role in this project was creating the interactive aspect of it. I got to engage with Django and it became one of my favorite web frameworks to work with.
